# Connected MaterialTable

This is an example of using [MaterialTable](https://github.com/mbrn/material-table) with
[Apollo graphql React Hooks](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/). This implementation
pushes the search and column ordering throught the graphql api, paginating the results for
large data sets.

You can achieve a basic crud interface with little to no effort! ðŸ˜±

### TODO

- [ ] Figure out how to export all, across pages.
